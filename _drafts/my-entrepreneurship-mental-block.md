I have a fairly broad set of interests.

In high school I took every science, math and language class that was offered. And today I continue to take interest courses and (try to) [learn new languages][1].

This was great, because I got to explore all kinds of different things.

One thing that never interested me much was "entrepreneurship". This probably goes back to high school, when a friend of mine took an entrepreneurship class. My impression was that this entrepreneurship thing was all about buying McDonald's franchises or starting a family restaurant or something. That's what I thought "entrepreneurship" was for a very long time.

Even as an adult, the term "entrepreneur" never felt right to me. I want to do something interesting, not be an entrepreneur!

I am currently reading [*Disciplined Entrepreneurship*][2], and I've found it immediately helpful. Right in the introduction the author distinguishes between "Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) Entrepreneurship" and "Innovation-Driven Enterprise (IDE) Entrepreneurship".

The former is what I believed entrepreneurship to be for half of my life: family-run dry cleaners, restaurants, convenience stores, franchises. There's nothing wrong with those types of businesses, but they don't interest me at all.

But the second kind of entrepreneurship is described as being

> the more risky and more ambitious of the two. IDE entrepreneurs are aspiring to serve markets that go well beyond the local market… These entrepreneurs… build their business off some technology, process, business model, or other innovation that will give them a significant competitive advantage

*That* sounds like a really engaging challenge. It's exactly what I've been feeling the need to do recently.

Finally I can reconcile the things I've been doing (and thinking about doing) for the last couple of years with the term "entrepreneurship".
