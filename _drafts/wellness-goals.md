Having been around successful entrepreneurs in the past I know that building my own product-based business is going to take an almost unimaginable amount of energy.

This isn't necessarily a bad thing. If I can find the right product I may have to actually put effort into not spending every waking minute working on it.

Based on articles that I've read in the past, as well as my own history when working really hard, I expect that staying healthy as I work on my business will be a real challenge. So I'm pseudo-publicly setting some wellness goals for myself in the hopes that this will give me some accountability.

## Exercise ##

I expect this to be a real challenge. I already exercise much less than I should. Every time I've managed to get into some kind of exercise routine in the past I've eventually ended up failing.

So I'm going to keep my initial exercise goals simple and achievable:

* Be active every day
* Be active for a total of five hours per week

"Be active" is deliberately vague, but I expect that a significant portion of my activity will be spent walking Kirby, our dog. This is something that I already do pretty regularly, but it doesn't count unless I actually keep track of it.

## Diet ##

This should be a bit easier. I love to cook, and I love to eat just about anything. The biggest challenge here is likely going to be taking time away from the business to actually prepare food.

My goals here are also reasonable, but are meant to address some of my personal nutritional weaknesses:

* Eat breakfast every day
* Eat fish at least once each week
* Eat at least one vegetarian lunch every week...
* ...and one vegetarian dinner, too
* Eat out at most two times per week

Eventually I'll add goals around caffeine and alcohol consumption, but right now I'm trying to keep my changes under control. The smaller they are, the more likely I'll be able to keep them.
