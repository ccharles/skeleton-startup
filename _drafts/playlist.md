I don't know very much about music, but I really like listening to it. Occasionally I'll find an artist, album, or song that really clicks for me as "working music". Head-down, gotta focus, driving, motivational stuff.

When that happens I'll list it here. We all have different musical tastes, but maybe you'll find that some of this music works for you, too.

## Now playing ##

My current favourite working album is [*The Discovery*][the-discovery], a 2008 instrumental progressive rock masterpiece by [Cloudkicker][cloudkicker]. I listen to this bad boy start to finish almost every day that I'm in front of a computer.

Here's a little something about the artist from his website:

> My name is Ben Sharp and I have been making music under the banner of Cloudkicker since 2007. I write, record, mix, and master everything at my home in Pittsburgh.

Cloudkicker's 2010 release [*Beacons*][beacons] is also in my regular rotation.
