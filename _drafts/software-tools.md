I don't even know what I'm going to be building yet, so I can't talk in-depth about the technologies that will be using. But a few things will almost certainly be involved...

## A strong foundation ##

* **Git.**
    * Standard `git` command-line toolset
    * GitLab.com
    * Magit
* **Emacs.**
* **An open source Unix or Unix-like environment.** Practically, for me this probably means Ubuntu Linux, Arch Linux, or FreeBSD.

## Programming languages ##

This is a bit trickier, as it will be highly project-dependent. I'm most comfortable working with Python 2, but that's probably not what I'll be using for this project. If Python is a good fit I'm determined to work with Python 3.

And if Python is *not* a good fit, I've got a big choice to make.
