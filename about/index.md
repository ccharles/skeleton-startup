My name is Chris, and I'm going to launch a product-based startup in 2015.

I've never founded a startup before. As I write this in mid-February, I don't know what problem I'm going to be solving, or who my cofounders will be. I don't even know which industry I'll be trying to improve.

As I go through the process of finding a cofounder, analyzing problems and testing possible solutions, gathering customer feedback, pivoting, marketing, and selling, I'll be writing.
