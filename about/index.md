My name is Chris, and I'm going to launch a product-based startup in 2015.

I'll be blogging about the process here, and I invite you to follow along. I have no doubt that this will be both exhilarating and terrifying. I expect to share victories and defeats with you, and I'll also give you a look at the process of building a startup.

## What's with the name? ##

The name "Skeleton Startup" is inspired by [skeleton watches][1]:

> A **skeleton watch** is a mechanical watch (although occasionally quartz), in which all of the moving parts are visible through either the front of the watch, the back of the watch or a small cut outlining the dial.

I intend to give you a similar view into my startup as I build it. Through this blog, you should get a glimpse of "all of the moving parts". Some parts will be almost fully visible, while others may be mostly hidden.
